# Raptor_data
Hello and welcome to my Repository! Here you will find data science projects done on Google Collab with Jupyter Notebooks using the Python language.
Each notebook is pretty much self explanatory.
Projects included so far:
1. A Restaurant review machine learning classifier including a WorldCloud output.
2. A web scraper that exports Maltapark listings to a csv.
3. A web scraper that scrapes job listings, populates a Database with the scraped data and sends an email with the newest job listigs.
4. An Image classifier applied to an image scraped live from a Harbor camera (Cirkewwa, Malta).
5. Using a web crawler to browse to a Chatbot site and recording the output to train a new chatbot live.
